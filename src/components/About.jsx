       As a recent graduate of CodeCool, I have developed my skills in a project-based learning environment, working in agile sprints and utilizing various tech stacks to build applications. Throughout my journey, I was fortunate to have been mentored by accomplished professionals in the field, providing me with invaluable guidance and insight into the industry. With a strong foundation in software development and a passion for learning, I am eager to embark on my next challenge.
       In addition to my technical skills, I am fluent in English, Hungarian, and have advanced knowledge of German. I am a good team-player, I value empathy and clear communication, but also have the ability to work independently.
